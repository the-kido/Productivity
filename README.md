#### ‚ö†Ô∏è This app is not production ready! 
It's missing lots of customizability features, and I haven't yet published the extension that works alongside this to block the websites you want. 
Basically, this is a mess. But it's my own, personal mess!

# üëã Welcome to my opinionated all-in-one helper app!
"The Prod App"'s goal is to include tons of modular features you can turn on or off as you wish. Features include:
- A website blocker, which holds you accountable for the sites you go onto (but shouldn't!)
- A reminders to get to bed in time
    - Grayscale, check-ins to keep you accountable, and more
- An easily accessible list of healthier tasks you can draw from instead of doomscrolling.
- And so much more!
